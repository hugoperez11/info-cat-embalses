## Description

The application allows users to visualize the current state of the internal basins of Catalonia, showing key data such as water level, stored volume, and the percentage of stored volume compared to the reservoir's total capacity. Our mission is to:
- Provide accurate and up-to-date data on the reservoirs.
- Promote awareness of the importance of water resources.
- Facilitate data-driven decision-making for governments, businesses, and citizens.

## Design
